# MACM 416 Final Project: Numerical Solution of the Heat Equation

This project focuses on partial differential equations (PDEs) by comparing numerical methods with deep learning methods.

The heat equation is a classical PDE equation, it is a differential equation containing partial derivatives. It describes the isotropic diffusion of a quantity, and is important for many applications in engineering and physics, among others.
